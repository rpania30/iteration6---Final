Self evaluation

- Database Integration and Data Migration (60 points):
Database Setup (20 points):
Successfully set up MongoDB, including installation, configuration, and connection to the web application. The database is operational and accessible.
Data Model Schema Design (10 points):

- Developed a comprehensive MongoDB schema that accurately represents the application's data model. For example, well-defined schemas for songs, DJs, playlists, and listener preferences.

Data Migration (10 points):
Executed a complete migration of existing data to the new database structure, ensuring that all previously hardcoded data is now stored and retrieved from the database. Data consistency is maintained.
Frontend and Backend Data Sync (20 points):
Successfully verified that frontend displays are updated to reflect backend data accurately after CRUD operations. For instance, changes made in the frontend (e.g., adding a song to a playlist) immediately update the display without requiring a page refresh.

- Dynamic UI Components (20 points):
Dynamic Creation of UI Components (10 points):
Implemented dynamic UI components that are generated from database content, ensuring that the UI always reflects current data. For example, dynamically generating lists of songs on a radio station's website.
Contextual Use of Static Displays (10 points):
Implemented static UI components appropriately, ensuring they are used when presenting options that are not expected to change dynamically.

- Session Management and Continuity (20 points):
Data Persistence and Restoration (10 points):
Ensured robust data persistence across page reloads. The session retains the correct state of the user's interaction, except for in-process actions. For instance, a scenario where a listener creating a list of favorite songs sees the list remain intact after a page reload.
Logout and Session Clearing (10 points):
Implemented an effective logout mechanism that clears the current session while preserving the user's data integrity in the database. The logout process maintains a seamless experience for the user.

*Overall*:
The web application demonstrates a solid integration with MongoDB, including a well-designed data model, successful data migration, and effective synchronization between frontend and backend data.
Dynamic UI components provide an engaging user experience, and session management ensures continuity and data integrity. 
The implementation meets or exceeds the specified criteria in each category of the rubric.
